Architecture
There were many types of frontend development tools and methods utilized within this project. MEAN stack was utilized and this meant 
that Express HTML, Javascript, and Angular were all used to help create a single-page application. Javascript was a strong language to 
utilize for this project as it offered many functions and abilities that could strengthen the frontend portion of this project. Express 
handles the primary user frontend, its utilization and structure was different from Angular. Express was had a simpler overall structure 
but offered was less fluid and responsive than angular. Single-page application was used as it fit the needs of the application. Its rapid 
updating and fluidity offered immense benefits.

MongoDB was utilized as the database because of its flexibility and ability to handle the requests and needs of the MEAN stack structure. 
SQL has some restricitions and limitations that wouldve caused some issues with its implmentation. 


Functionality
JSON is a lightweight format that is meant for transporting or storing data. Its strictly meant for data and doesnt have any direct executable 
code whilst javascript does. This can help with interactions with other componenets of the application. JSON would be used to send or receive 
information and then Javascript would be utilized to process and handle the funcitonalities of the JSON formatting.

There were many instances of improving the funcitionalities and effiencies of the code. Throghout the modules more and more improvements were
made to these two aspects of the applicaiton. And example of this was seperatong out the data and contents of the travel packages page into their
own dedicated file rather than having all the data and contents with the HTML display of the page. Many functionalities were added such as updating,
deleitng or adding packages from the admin users perspective among many other effency improvements.


Testing
There were a couple different methods in testing and utiizing the different API endpoints. One application tool used was Postman. By utizing this tool
I could put my application directly onto the tool and call to direct endpoints such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. These endpoints would test adding, updating,
deleting or retriving trip data. By utilizing the Mongo compass application tool we could validate if the data was being effected after the successful 
executions within Postman. In addition to postman running the application directly and utiizing the offered front end functionalities. Security was added
and these tools were directly applied to test authentication as well. The same endpoints can be test the login database and can directly relay access and
authentication information.


Reflection
This course has helped me greatly with my professional development. I learned a throughout this course and learned many new skillsets, tools and 
concepts that I wasnt previously familiar with. Whilst I am very familiar with Javascript and some of the tools such as HTML and MongoDB, I wasnt
familiar with Angular and how these tools can all come together to create a Single-Page applicatition. Ive never used MEAN stack prior to this class 
and learning about how each component and tools builds and works off one another was incredbily informative. Refractering codes, adding functionalities,
boosting effencieies and adding securiy is all releavent to my professional career path and the skills and lessons that I developed throughout this course,
will be repeadetly revisted and called upon throughout my journey.
